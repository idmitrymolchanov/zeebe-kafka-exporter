 *
 * <p>NOTE: while it may seem like overhead to create this abstraction, it gives us the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Separation of concerns allowing us to test the Kafka Producer specific code in a more
 *       narrow setting, making it easier to unit test
 *   <li>Easily swap out the default transactional behavior later on for a non transactional one if
 *       there are major downsides with transactions (as we still need to deal with at least once
 *       anyway due to Zeebe)
