   * Controls the number of records to buffer in a single record batch before forcing a flush. Note
   * that a flush may occur before anyway due to periodic flushing. This setting should help you
   * estimate a soft upper bound to the memory consumption of the exporter. If you assume a worst
   * case scenario where every record is the size of your zeebe.broker.network.maxMessageSize, then
   * the memory required by the exporter would be at least: (maxBatchSize *
   * zeebe.broker.network.maxMessageSize * 2)
   *
   * <p>We multiply by 2 as the records are buffered twice - once in the exporter itself, and once
   * in the producer's network buffers (but serialized at that point). There's some additional
   * memory overhead used by the producer as well for compression/encryption/etc., so you have to
   * add a bit, but that one is not proportional to the number of records and is more or less
   * constant.
   *
   * <p>Once the batch has reached this size, a flush is automatically triggered. Too small a number
   * here would cause many flush, which is not good for performance, but would mean you will see
   * your records faster/sooner.
